# My JavaScript Journey 🚀

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning and growth in JavaScript! This folder contains projects that showcase my skills, creativity, and understanding of JavaScript concepts. I aim to steadily improve by tackling increasingly complex projects, starting with the basics and building up to a real-world application.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. **Counter App**
   - **Description**: A simple app that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value. 
   - **Concepts Covered**: DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic state management.
   - **Status**: 🚧 In Progress / ✅ Completed

---

### 2. **Weather App**
   - **Description**: An app that fetches and displays real-time weather data for a city entered by the user.
   - **Concepts Covered**: Fetch API, asynchronous JavaScript (promises and `async/await`), and JSON handling.
   - **Status**: 🚧 In Progress / ✅ Completed

---

### 3. **Image Search App**
   - **Description**: A search engine for images using a public API (e.g., Unsplash API). Users can enter keywords to fetch and display relevant images.
   - **Concepts Covered**: Working with APIs, managing API keys, and responsive design with JavaScript.
   - **Status**: 🚧 In Progress / ✅ Completed

### 4. **Real-World JavaScript Project: Task Management App**
   - **Description**: A fully functional task management application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize tasks into categories. The app includes authentication and data persistence via a backend or local storage.
   - **Features**:
     - User authentication (sign-up/login/logout)
     - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks
     - Categorization and prioritization of tasks
     - A responsive, user-friendly interface
   - **Concepts Covered**: Full-stack JavaScript, working with a database (if applicable), local storage, and advanced JavaScript techniques.
   - **Status**: 🚧 Planned

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS
- **APIs**: Fetch API, public APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Unsplash)
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: (Optional, e.g., React for the final project)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
